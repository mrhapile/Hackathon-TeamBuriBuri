🏆 Hackathon Submission: InnovEdam 2025

Problem Statement 1: Campus Companion Build for students, by students.

📖 Executive Summary

UniRank is a dual-purpose platform designed to solve the two biggest anxieties of a first-year student: fitting in socially and securing future employability.

By gamifying day-to-day academic life, UniRank turns attendance, assignments, and project work into a competitive 'Pro Score', while campus engagement contributes to a 'Social Score'. For recruiters, UniRank transforms static resumes into a dynamic, data-driven living profile.

🚩 The Problem

For Students:

Invisibility: Feeling lost in the crowd during the first year.

Unnoticed Effort: Daily discipline (attendance, small projects) isn't captured in traditional marks.

Late Start: Resume building usually happens too late (final year).

For Recruiters:

Static Data: Resumes are often exaggerated and lack depth.

Missing Context: No data on soft skills, consistency, or daily discipline.

💡 The Solution: A Living Profile

UniRank introduces a dynamic ecosystem where every action counts.

Pro Card: Tracks career stats (EI Score, Attendance, Skills).

Social Card: Tracks campus life (Karma, Events, Networking).

✨ Key Features

1. 📊 Smart Student Dashboard

A glassmorphic, aesthetic command center showing real-time stats.

Employability Index (EI) Ring: Visualizes the "credit score" for hiring.

Activity Heatmap: GitHub-style tracking for daily academic consistency.

Badge System: Gamified rewards (e.g., "Consistency King", "Hackathon Hero").

2. 🤝 Discover & Networking

Skill-Based Matching: A Tinder-style swipe interface to find study partners or project collaborators based on skills, not looks.

Smart Filtering: Gender-based logic ensures comfortable networking environments.

3. 📈 Analytics Suite

Attendance Calculator: Visual gauges predicting "Safe Skips" vs. attendance targets.

Certificate Verification: Simulated AI verification flow for uploading and validating achievements.

4. 💬 Integrated Chat

Real-time Messaging: iMessage-style interface with typing indicators and simulated bot responses.

Context Aware: Matches appear instantly after swiping.

5. 🏢 Recruiter Dashboard (Landing Demo)

3D Scroll Card: Interactive 3D component showcasing how recruiters filter candidates.

Live Search: Filter students by "Dev", "Design", or "Data" roles.

🛠️ Tech Stack

This project was built using a lightweight, high-performance stack for the 24-hour hackathon constraints:

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Modern Variables, Flexbox/Grid)

Styling: Custom Glassmorphism UI system, Pastel Color Palette (Sage/Cream).

Animations: GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) for ScrollTrigger, FLIP transitions, and physics-based interactions.

Data Persistence: LocalStorage (Simulating a database for the hackathon demo).

Icons: FontAwesome 6.4.

⚙️ How to Run Locally

Clone the Repository

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/unirank.git](https://github.com/your-username/unirank.git)


Open the Project
Navigate to the project folder.

Launch
Open index.html in your browser.

Tip: Use VS Code's "Live Server" extension for the best experience with animations.

🧮 The "Secret Sauce" Algorithm

We calculate the Employability Index (EI) using a weighted formula:

EI = (A \times 0.4) + (P \times 0.4) + (C \times 0.2)


A (Attendance): Consistency in classes.

P (Projects): GitHub activity and project complexity.

C (Certifications): Verified skills and badges.

This score normalizes to 1000, giving recruiters a single metric to gauge potential.

🔮 Future Scope

Backend Integration: Move from LocalStorage to Firebase/MongoDB.

Real AI Verification: Integrate OCR APIs to actually read uploaded certificates.

LMS Sync: Connect with Moodle/Canvas for automated attendance tracking.

Monetization: Subscription model for recruiters to access "Top 1%" talent data.
